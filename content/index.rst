.. prereq::

   * During the bootcamp we will run Python code using notebooks. While being able to code is not a prerequisite, if you are familiar with notebooks it might be easier to get you started. You can watch an introduction to Jupyter notebook here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfAQzTahbyU
   * You don't have to bring your own data, but if you do, then it is important that you run the notebook on your laptop if privacy is a concern. For installing the necessary software to run the code from your laptop, see the **installation page**.
